# **Tracking a Basketball in a Video**

## Introduction
<div align="justify">
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracking a ball in a video using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) involves identifying the ball based on its color properties and following its motion across frames. This approach leverages HSV's ability to separate color information (hue) from lighting variations (saturation and value), making it effective under varying conditions like shadows or bright spots. Its significance in computer vision lies in applications like sports analytics, motion prediction, and robotics, where precise and real-time tracking enables automated decision-making, enhanced game analysis, and interaction with dynamic objects in complex environments.
